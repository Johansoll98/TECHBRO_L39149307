                <h1>Upgrading your laptop</h1>
                <p>Date: October 8</p>

                <h2>When does it make sense to upgrade your laptop?</h2>

                <p>First of all, it is important to understand that laptops are not as easy to upgrade as desktop computers. Usually, upgrade options are limited. In most models it is very ​easy​ to increase ​RAM​ and ​hard drive​. It is also possible to upgrade using ​external accessories. It always makes sense to upgrade your laptop if it ​is not very old​ and you want to ​speed up​ the laptop. Additional RAM is ideal for this. However, a laptop that is not very expensive and is not the fastest at the time of purchase will not become a racing car, even if it has RAM added.</p>

                <h2>How much does it cost to upgrade a laptop?</h2>

                <p>It always depends on what needs to be installed. RAM​ is currently ​inexpensive, with 16 GB available for less than 50 euros. Prices for ​hard drives​ are also reasonable. And although their prices are constantly changing, on average 1 TB SSD drives can be purchased for less than 100 euros. The cost of upgrading a laptop will depend on the ​model​ and its configuration. For an inexpensive laptop, you can find many inexpensive components. Higher quality models that are already equipped with high performance and quality components should be upgraded with equivalent components. Thus, upgrading a ​gaming laptop​ will cost a little more than upgrading an office laptop.</p>

                <h2>What to look for when upgrading a laptop?</h2>

                <p>First of all, you need to check whether the laptop can be upgraded at all. On most models, at least some components can be easily replaced. But there are also models that are ​difficult or even ​impossible to update. These usually include modern ultrabooks, which are particularly thin. They have a very thin case, into which both the hard drive and the main memory are often soldered. Therefore, updating in their case is impossible. Laptops with so-called unibody cases have a similar problem. In such models it is usually impossible to even look at the internal filling, let alone replace it. Laptops with a screen of 15 inches or larger can usually be upgraded. There is plenty of space inside these models. However, many manufacturers do not make it easy for users to access internal mechanisms. Cases are often so difficult to open that you lose the desire to upgrade. But there are also manufacturers who make replacing some components easy. To do this, service covers are installed in the devices, which, for example, allow you to easily replace the hard drive or RAM. Some gaming laptops can also be upgraded. Even then, it is very easy to upgrade your laptop. However, before replacing components, it is recommended to consult the manual. Many models already come with instructions for updating components. It is also important to ​buy components​ ​compatible with the laptop.</p>

                <h2>Is it possible to increase RAM on a laptop?</h2>

                <p>Memory​ is one of the laptop components that can usually be upgraded very easily. Many models do not even need to open the case. They have ​special hatches on the bottom that allow you to access the memory chips by unscrewing the screws. These chips are located directly under the cover and can be easily replaced or expanded. The only exceptions are laptops in which the memory is soldered in. In such models, at a minimum, it is impossible to replace the main memory. However, some models can use additional RAM. Increasing your laptop's RAM is one of the easiest tasks when upgrading a laptop.</p>

                <h2>Is it possible to upgrade the processor on a laptop?</h2>

                <p>It is generally possible to upgrade a laptop's processor, but this is recommended only in exceptional cases.​ Although many laptops offer the option of replacing the processor, it is usually not worth the effort and expense. ​The processor​ is the heart of the laptop and is responsible for its performance. Many manufacturers allow replacement, but there are still many older laptops that have the ​CPU soldered​ to the motherboard. In this case, replacement is not possible. It should also be noted that this update is often associated with high risk. To replace the processor, you usually have to disassemble the laptop and then remove the cooling system. Of course, the new processor must match the laptop motherboard. But even if this is the case, this does not mean that the new processor will work normally. Replacing the processor may lead to ​unstable operation of the system, for example due to power problems or too ​high heat output​. In the worst case, ​the laptop can be ​damaged.</p>

                <h2>Is it possible to upgrade the video card on a laptop?</h2>

                <p>In theory, you can upgrade your video card, but it's usually not worth it. Embedded video cards are difficult to obtain, and the location of components often does not match. In addition, problems with compatibility of cooling systems often arise. Therefore, when ​buying a laptop​ it is better to choose ​a sufficiently powerful video card. In addition, in many laptops the video card is soldered to the motherboard, making it impossible to replace it. The best way to upgrade your laptop's graphics card is to use an ​external graphics card​.</p>
