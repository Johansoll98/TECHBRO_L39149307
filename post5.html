                <h1>Clearing iPhone storage</h1>
                <p>Date: October 8</p>

                <h2>Using cloud storage</h2>

                <p>Cloud services will help you store, synchronize and edit files without filling up your iPhone's memory. By default, storage offers some storage for free, but if you want to store a million photos and videos, you'll have to fork out the cash. Here are some of the most popular cloud storage services:</p>

                <p>• iCloud</p>

                <p>Apple’s “native” cloud service, pre-installed on iPhone by default. The free version has 5 GB of memory available.</p>

                <p>• Google Drive</p>

                <p>Storage developed by Google. By default, 15 GB of memory is provided, but you can also purchase three tariff packages: Basic (100 GB), Standard (200 GB) and Premium (2 TB).</p>

                <p>• Dropbox</p>

                <p>This file hosting comes with 2 GB of storage space available after registration. In the paid version, you can choose tariffs for personal use (Plus, Family) or business (Professional, Standard, Advanced).</p>

                <h2>Cleaning files from messengers and social networks</h2>

                <p>Messengers and social networks take up almost the most memory on any device. With iPhone, you can stop automatic update downloads or set app size limits. In the latter case, if the new versions weigh a lot, the gadget will ask for permission to download. The path is: “Settings” - App Store - “Automatic downloads”.</p>

                <p>Messengers can be cleared of unnecessary media files from the applications themselves. For example, to refresh WhatsApp, you need to go to the main menu “Settings” - “Data and storage” - “Storage management”. Select unnecessary photos or videos there and delete. For Telegram, approximately the same scheme applies. In the settings, go to the “Data and Memory” menu - “Memory Usage”. There you can configure the storage period for files, their total maximum size and clear the cache.</p>

                <h2>Cleaning up unnecessary media files</h2>

                <p>Photos and videos from iPhone are not deleted immediately, but first go to the trash, where they are stored for 29 days in case you change your mind and want to restore them. To completely delete media files, you need to go to the “Albums” section, scroll down and find “Recently Deleted” there, select unnecessary pictures and click on the “Delete All” button. Deleting a large number of photos in this mode can take a lot of time. For this case, there are special applications that will help simplify the process, but more on them later.</p>

                <p>You can also turn off iCloud Photos and Shared Albums. In the first case, media files are downloaded to all your devices linked to one account. In the second, you can create shared albums with other users. These all clog up the system, so you can turn them off. To do this, go to “Settings” - Apple ID - iCloud - “Photos” and there switch the toggle switches “iCloud Photos” and “Shared Albums”.</p>

                <h2>Uninstalling unused apps</h2>

                <p>One of the most obvious ways to clean up your iPhone is to simply remove programs you don't use. For example, we went to a restaurant, and they gave a discount for installing their application. You may never visit the establishment again, and the downloaded application will remain hanging as a dead weight. Running in the background and push notifications slow down your smartphone, and removing them can significantly lighten the memory of your mobile device.</p>

                <p>Alternatively, you can download the application: all history, documents and data will be saved, but it will not take up space. Go to “Settings” → “General” → “iPhone Storage” and select a rarely used program. Click on the "Download App" button and voila! - a cloud will appear next to its icon on the home screen. To return the program back, just tap on it once, and it will download itself from the App Store with all the previous data. You can also configure automatic unloading of unused applications. Go to “Settings” - App Store and click on “Download unused”.</p>

                <p>If you just want to delete the application, then proceed as in the first case. Only instead of “Download application”, click, respectively, “Delete application”.</p>

                <h2>Alternatively, you can use storage cleaning apps for iPhone:</h2>
