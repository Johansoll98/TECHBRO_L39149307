                <h1>Replacing displays on Samsungs</h1>
                <p>Date: October 8</p>

                <h2>The process of replacing a broken or faulty Samsung display</h2>

                <p>All modern flagship gadgets of the Korean company have a display module that simultaneously performs the functions of a sensor and a screen. It consists of a main block (screen) and cables connected to the device’s system board. You can find high-quality displays on sale, which will not be difficult to install yourself. For this you need to have a simple tool, be careful and have at least some understanding of the operating principles and structure of electronics.</p>

                <h2>Samsung Display Replacement Tools</h2>

                <p>• Shaped screwdrivers. On sale you can find specialized sets that include cross and star nozzles. To save money, you can buy screwdrivers for mobile phone repair separately.</p>

                <p>• Plastic card, pick or any other thin and flat instrument. Needed to divide the smartphone case into two parts.</p>

                <p>• Hair dryer. A “homemade” one is suitable for drying hair, the main thing is that it can heat the surface to 60-70 degrees Celsius.</p>

                <p>• Rubber suction cup with ring.</p>

                <p>• Glue type B-7000 or any high-quality analogue.</p>

                <p>• Alcohol or other glass cleaner, small wipes or rags.</p>

                <h2>Step-by-step algorithm of actions</h2>

                <p>• Disassembling the smartphone case. If the back cover is removable, open it and take out the battery. In the case of a non-removable one, you need to separate it using a plastic card or a mediator. We unscrew all the bolts, carefully separate the case and disconnect the cables from the module to the smartphone board.</p>

                <p>• Removing the display module. Use a hairdryer to thoroughly heat the perimeter of the damaged display to soften the glue. Glue the suction cup with the ring to its surface and gently pull it towards you. Remember that you must first disconnect the cables from the board so as not to damage the contacts on the motherboard.</p>

                <p>• Preparing space for a new module. We remove the remnants of old glue using alcohol and small napkins. We work carefully so as not to damage anything.</p>

                <p>• Installing the display module. We unpack the new display, peel off the cables from its body, thread them into the sockets and connect them to the contacts. We insert the battery and check the functionality of the module. If everything is functioning normally, disconnect the cables, take out the display, apply B-7000 glue around the perimeter of the seat. Carefully insert the module back, not forgetting to thread the cables, and glue it to the body. We remove any residual glue that appears with a napkin.</p>

                <p>• Assembling a smartphone. We attach the cables and assemble our device in the reverse order.</p>
