                <h1>How to clean your PC from dust?</h1>
                <p>Date: October 8</p>

                    <p>Basic computer cleaning is sometimes simply unavoidable. By following the instructions below, you can carry out a thorough cleaning without any problems.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Step 1: Remove Large Contaminants</h2>
                    <p>A vacuum cleaner is best for this. It is advisable to first remove the housing cover. Then check that all parts are screwed tightly. The case screws should be placed in a safe place to avoid losing them.
                    
                    To prevent the fan blades from rotating, you can tie them together with a cable tie. This will prevent damage. You can now carefully start vacuuming at the lowest suction power.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Step 2: Remove minor dirt</h2>
                    <p>The boards are very vulnerable, so it is better to clean them with a brush. With its help, you can easily clean even hard-to-reach places from dust. Compressed air cans with a nozzle tube are also practical, which will help remove lost hairs or brush bristles.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Step 3: Remove stubborn dirt</h2>
                    <p>If the vacuum cleaner and other accessories no longer work, you can remove the case fans and other components. You can now remove more stubborn dirt with a brush or toothbrush. The housing fan blades can simply be washed with water. It is better not to use chemical cleaning products.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Step 4: Clean the CPU Cooler</h2>
                    <p>It is necessary to thoroughly clean the processor, because it is also important for processing power. If the processor cooler is very dirty, it is better to remove it. This way you can get to the dirt from all sides, and also replace the thermal paste. For minor stains, a vacuum cleaner, toothbrush and brush will also help.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Step 5: Replace Thermal Paste</h2>
                    <p>If the processor cooler is removed, you can also replace the thermal paste. Although this is not always necessary, it is recommended to do this if any part of the cooler falls off when removing it. First of all, you need to remove all its remnants. A soft cloth or gasoline for cleaning is suitable for this. New thermal paste should be applied sparingly and carefully.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Step 6: Clean your graphics card</h2>
                    <p>First of all, you need to remove the video card. This way you can clean the slot on the motherboard. The heatsink should only be removed from the video card if absolutely necessary. Cleaning the gaps is usually sufficient.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Step 7: Avoid Cable Clutter</h2>
                    <p>Dangling cords make cleaning difficult. In addition, they attract dust well, which is then distributed throughout the body and settles there. Therefore, care should be taken to ensure that cables do not block the air flow from the fans. In addition, they must lie in groups in the housing. You can use cable ties for this. It is necessary to ensure that the ends do not dangle in the housing.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Step 8: Install the Dust Filter</h2>
                    <p>Dust filters come in different shapes and sizes. You can buy them both in specialized stores and on the Internet. They are quick and easy to install and prevent dust from settling on the fan blades.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Step 9: Clean Input Devices</h2>
                    <p>The surface of the keyboard and mouse can be wiped with a damp cloth. Dirt that has accumulated in the gaps between the keys can be carefully removed by turning the keyboard over. Or you can remove it with tweezers. You can also use compressed air from a can. In addition, you can disassemble the case and wipe the rubber mat inside first with a damp and then with a dry cloth.</p>
